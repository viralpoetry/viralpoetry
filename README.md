I am a security DevOps engineer interested in applied cryptography, information security and trustless systems of any kind. I am using Python, CI/CD, gitops & immutable infrastructure. I prefer to automate repetitive tasks in order to save time for more interesting work.

I am also familiar with the cryptography, key management, Hardware Secure Modules (HSM), threat modeling. I can brainstorm attacks, hence I can improve the security landscape of an organization.
I am following trends in the cybercrime, malware and cryptography. I read scientific publications, blogs, news. I like to write my thoughts, occasionally I even [publish something](https://www.malgregator.com/).
